        <h1>The Call You Missed Was Worth $2,400</h1>
        
        <p>It came in at 2:47 PM on a Tuesday. You were finishing a color correction that was already running late. By the time you checked your phone, they'd already booked somewhere else.</p>
        
        <p>That's not a business problem. That's a <em>heartbreak you can hear ringing</em>.</p>
        
        <a href="#demo" class="cta-button open-chat">Book a Free Demo</a>

        <h2>You Chose This. Then Reality Showed Up.</h2>
        
        <p>You didn't stumble into this business. Maybe you were the kid giving friends haircuts in your basement. Or you spent years apprenticing under someone who taught you that ink is permanent, so respect is everything.</p>
        
        <p>You saw a vision: creative freedom, happy clients, a business that reflects who you actually are.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Then the phone became the boss of you.</strong></p>
        
        <p>No-shows carve holes in your schedule. You're answering the same five questions at 9 PM that you answered at 9 AM. Your Instagram has 47 unread DMs and you're too exhausted to respond.</p>
        
        <p>You're not running your business anymore. Your business is running you.</p>

        <h2>I Built This Because I'm Done Watching Talented People Drown in Busywork</h2>
        
        <p>I spent years in a Fortune 500 corner cubicle. Good salary. Soul-crushing reality.</p>
        
        <p>Every day: politics, pointless meetings, corporate theater. I was making money but nothing that mattered.</p>

		<p>Then I talked to people running their own businesses - tattoo artists, hairstylists, barbers, groomers. People who'd taken the leap I was too scared to take.</p>
        
        <p>Same story, every time: "<strong>I love what I do. I hate everything else I have to do, to do it.</strong>"</p>
        
        <p>You didn't become a barber to answer phones during a fade. You didn't learn tattooing to play receptionist. You got into this because you're damn good at your craft and wanted freedom to do it your way.</p>
        
        <p>But instead? Texting clients at 10 PM. Juggling three booking platforms. Losing bookings because you can't answer your phone while holding clippers or a tattoo gun.</p>

		<div class="sound-familiar">The administrative nonsense was burying the actual work.</div>

		<p>So I quit. Walked away from corporate comfort and built something that actually helps.</p>
        
        <p>Weeks in a dark garage, Wi-Fi dropping every time someone used the microwave. Glued to my screen. My eye prescription jumping two points!</p>
        
        <div class="handwritten">
            <strong>I wasn't building the next tech unicorn.</strong> I wanted to solve one problem: how do talented people stop losing clients to logistics?
        </div>
        
        <p>The answer: <strong>An AI receptionist that doesn't suck.</strong></p>
        
        <p>Not some clunky chatbot that sounds like a vending machine. A real assistant that understands what you do, how you talk, and what your clients need to hear.</p>

        <div class="section-divider">✂</div>

        <div class="motto">
            Never Miss Another Client.<br>Never Hire Another Receptionist.
        </div>

        <p>Think of it like this: <strong>You know how hiring a great receptionist would change everything?</strong> Someone who knows your services inside and out, never takes a sick day, answers every call on the first ring, and works for less than $2/day?</p>
        
        <p>That's exactly what this is. Except it never sleeps, never quits, and gets smarter the longer it works for you.</p>

        <div class="actionable-box">
            <p><strong>Here's the truth about missed bookings:</strong> Research shows that <span class="stats">80% of callers won't leave a voicemail</span>, and <span class="stats">67% won't call back</span> if they don't reach someone immediately. Every missed call isn't just one lost booking, it's often a client you'll never hear from again.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;"><strong>Even if you're not ready for an AI receptionist, here's what you need to fix right now:</strong></p>
        </div>

        <ul class="checkmark-list">
            <li><strong>Stop using voicemail as your primary backup</strong> - Clients interpret it as "we're too busy for you"</li>
            <li><strong>Track your missed calls for one week</strong> - You'll be shocked at what you're losing</li>
            <li><strong>Calculate the real cost</strong> - Average booking value × missed calls per week = your invisible revenue leak</li>
            <li><strong>Respond to DMs within 4 hours</strong> - After that, conversion rates drop by 400%</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="highlight-box">
            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 15px; font-size: 1.2rem;">Here's what my AI receptionist does all day (and all night):</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Answers every call, text, and DM instantly</strong> at 2 PM or 2 AM, doesn't matter</li>
                <li><strong>Knows your services, pricing, and availability cold</strong> like a receptionist who's been with you for years</li>
                <li><strong>Books appointments directly into your calendar</strong> no back-and-forth, no double-bookings, no "let me check and get back to you"</li>
                <li><strong>Sends automatic reminders</strong> reducing no-shows by 60-70% on average (that's industry standard for good reminder systems)</li>
                <li><strong>Talks like a human, not a robot</strong> I've spent two years and tested thousands of conversations to get this right</li>
                <li><strong>Learns your vibe over time</strong> adapts to your specific language, services, and common questions</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">I built this system handling over <span class="stats">10,000 conversations</span> across dozens of businesses. It's not perfect, but it catches <span class="stats">95%+ of bookable opportunities</span> that would otherwise be lost.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="motto">
            Never miss another client.<br>Never hire another receptionist.<br>That's the deal.

            <p><strong>Before:</strong> You're mid-service when your phone explodes. By the time you check it, three potential clients have already booked elsewhere. You spend lunch playing catch-up. You go home wondering how long you can keep this up.</p>

        <div class="before-after" style="background: #e6f5e6; border-left-color: #4a904a;">
            <p><strong>After:</strong> You're mid-service when your phone buzzes. Your AI receptionist is already handling it, answering questions about your after-care process, checking your calendar, booking Thursday at 2 PM, sending a confirmation text. You finish your work, glance at your schedule, and it's fuller than it's been in months. You go home on time. With energy left over.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section-divider">✂</div>

        <h2>This Isn't Just About More Bookings</h2>
        
        <p><strong>It's about getting back to the work that makes you forget to check your phone.</strong></p>
        
        <p>The precision of a perfect fade. The way a client tears up when they see their new color. The quiet pride of a dog who was scared at the start and is wagging by the end.</p>
        
        <p>That flow state. That's what you're here for.</p>
        
        <p>Your AI receptionist handles everything else.</p>

        <h2>I'm Not a Big Company. But I Know This Problem Cold.</h2>
        
        <p>When you email me, you get <em>me</em>. Just a guy who genuinely cares but also sometimes replies at 2 AM because I have the sleep schedule of a raccoon.</p>
        
        <p>When something breaks, I'm the one who fixes it, usually same day, sometimes at 1 AM in my pajamas. Is that healthy? Probably not. Does your problem get solved? Absolutely.</p>
        
        <div class="actionable-box">
            <p><strong>But here's what matters more than my quirks:</strong> I've spent two years and over 10,000 real conversations refining this system. I know exactly where appointment-based businesses leak revenue (response time delays, unclear pricing info, booking friction). I've tested every edge case, the 2 AM drunk texts, the "do you do [thing you definitely don't do]" questions, the people who ghost after three messages.</p>
        </div>
        
        <p>I answer emails fast. I don't hide behind corporate-speak when I mess up (and I <em>do</em> mess up, remember that "BOOKING CONFIRMED" disaster?).</p>
        
        <div class="handwritten">
            <strong>Here's the reality:</strong>

                <li>I once spent six hours debugging an issue that was just me spelling "calendar" wrong</li>
                <li>I will absolutely hop on a call at weird hours if something's urgent</li>
                <li>I still google things constantly (that's how you stay current)</li>
                <li>There's a 40% chance I'm wearing sweatpants right now</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <p><strong>But I also know this:</strong> Your biggest competition isn't other salons or studios. It's every business that responds faster than you do. That's the game now.</p>
        
        <p>If you want someone who treats your business like it matters and has actually solved this problem hundreds of times, I'm here.</p>

        <h2>What You Get</h2>
        
        <ul class="checkmark-list">
            <li><strong>Never miss another booking</strong>: your AI receptionist answers 24/7 (proven 95%+ capture rate)</li>
            <li><strong>Never hire front desk staff</strong>: save $30K+ per year on salary, taxes, and benefits</li>
            <li><strong>60-70% fewer no-shows</strong>: automatic reminders that actually work</li>
            <li><strong>4x faster response times</strong>: instant answers build trust and close bookings</li>
            <li><strong>Your time back</strong>: reclaim 10-15 hours per week for actual client work</li>
            <li><strong>Real support when you need it</strong>: me, not a ticket system</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="actionable-box">
            <p><strong>Here's what this solves even if you don't use my service:</strong></p>
            
            <p>The biggest profit leak in appointment-based businesses isn't marketing or pricing, it's the gap between interest and booking. Every hour you don't respond, your conversion rate drops.</p>
            
            <p>If you take nothing else from this: <strong>track your response times and missed opportunities for one week</strong>. Write down every call you couldn't take, every DM you answered 6 hours late, every potential client who ghosted. Calculate what those bookings were worth.</p>
            
            <p><strong>That number is your invisible revenue leak.</strong> And it's probably way bigger than you think.</p>

            <p>I'll show you exactly how your AI receptionist would handle your actual clients, answer your specific questions, and whether this makes sense for your business.</p>

            <p><strong>Princess Light Media</strong></p>
            <p>I help hair salons, tattoo parlors, nail studios, aesthetic clinics, gyms and fitness studios, massage therapy, dog groomers, and other passion-driven businesses take back their time with AI receptionists that actually work.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-size: 0.85rem;">I left corporate life to do this because value is king, and nothing gets me higher than watching talented people get back to doing what they love. ❤️</p>
