      <h1>You’re Burned Out. So Were We. That’s Why We Built This.</h1>

      <h2>Meet the Brand</h2>
      <p>At <strong>Princess Light Media</strong>, we’re not a big tech firm or an agency with a shiny slide deck. We’re a scrappy little crew that got tired of watching small clinics drown in repetitive admin, missed calls, and chaotic schedules.</p>
      <p>We’ve seen amazing therapists spend more time answering “Do you take Blue Cross?” than helping patients heal. That’s backwards. So we built a friendly AI assistant that actually lightens the load.</p>
      <p>It’s not magic. But it works—and it keeps getting better.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Sound familiar?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You miss calls and lose bookings when you’re with a patient</li>
        <li>No-shows and cancellations cost you hours every week</li>
        <li>Your team is answering the same 5 questions over and over</li>
        <li>You want to market better but don’t have time or energy</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Here’s how we help:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Your AI assistant chats naturally with patients 24/7</li>
        <li>Answers questions about services, pricing, and insurance</li>
        <li>Books appointments straight into your calendar</li>
        <li>Sends confirmations and reminders automatically</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>We’re Not Fancy. We’re Focused.</h2>
      <p>We’ve broken our own calendar more than once. We don’t use words like “synergy.” But we care deeply about solving real problems for real businesses—especially small ones.</p>
      <p>If you’re a hands-on clinic owner tired of duct-taping together systems, we see you. We built this for you.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What You’ll Actually Get Out of This</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>✅ Fewer no-shows and more completed plans of care</li>
        <li>✅ Less chaos at the front desk</li>
        <li>✅ Happier patients who don’t have to wait for answers</li>
        <li>✅ More time for the work you actually love</li>
        <li>✅ A partner who gives a damn (and responds to emails quickly)</li>
      </ul>
